# What is TDD?

Test Driven Development is an approach to software development, based on writing tests first, followed by just enough production code to fulfill that test. Upon passing, the code is then refactored.


### 1) You Write A Failing Test ❌ 

### 2) You Write An Implemention To Make The Test Pass ✔️

### 3) Refactor The Code To Make The Implementation Better ✅ 👍
